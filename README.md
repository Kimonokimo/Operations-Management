* Generated large scale data such as the total revenue, safety inventory and lead time demand to predict and manage the factory capacity.

* Computed the economic order quantity based on the records of first 70 days to avoid inventory shortage and unnecessary orders.

* Conducted contract analysis in Excel by depicting the relationship between contract lead time and total revenue.

* Analyzed average demand, EOQ and ROP to maximize total revenue, optimized the EOQ around Day 200 to save the cash interests and achieved a first place among 11 teams.
